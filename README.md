# Full-Stack-Weather-App
**App is not complete yet**
This is a full-stack weather app that i've created using Nodejs and Expressjs. I'm also using two diffrent Rest APIs to get weather data and autocomplete on any given address.
Everything is being bundeled up by webpack 5. The app is almost complete and will be hosted on heroku or vercel.
